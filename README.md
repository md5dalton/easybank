## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS Extension Language

### What I learned

I've never used multiple image backgrounds before. I took a dive into it...

```css
    background-position: center top -40px, center top
    background-size: 90%, auto
    background-image: 
        url('./../../dist/images/image-mockups.png'), 
        url('./../../dist/images/bg-intro-mobile.svg')

```
### Continued development

- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - I was confortable with [Less](https://lesscss.org/) but I've fallen in love with Sass and it has only been a few days since I started with it

## Acknowledgments

- [Coder Coder](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCoderCoder) Has a very helpful [practical tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCoderCoder) for beginners in HTML, CSS, JS. I followed along on another project and decided to implement this one the way I was confortable with.
